Last December, I started taking [Coursera's Machine Learning course][coursera-ml] by Prof. Andrew Ng. This course has been a remarkable success since it's inception in 2011. I would recommend everyone with interest in Machine Learning and related areas, to take this course and get a solid fundamental background. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:

1. Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
2. Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
3. Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
